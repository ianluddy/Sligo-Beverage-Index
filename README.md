### Q & A

1. How long did it take to complete the solution?

    - About 4 hours

2. What would you add if you had more time?

    - Automated testing
    - SASS
    - A nice navbar logo
    - Pagination

3. How would you deploy this to production?

    - Use the Angular CLI to build solution in production mode using 'ng build --prod'
    - Serve using Apache on an AWS EC2 instance
    - Configure SSL encryption
    - Configure Google Analytics

4. How would you debug it in production?

    **Client side**
    - Load the app in Chrome
    - Check the console for errors, use debugger if necessary
    - Check network console for failing requests
    - You could also use something like Augury to debug (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/augury/elgalmkoelokbchhkhacckoklkejnhcd)

    **Server side**
    - SSH onto the box
    - Check Apache error and access logs
    - Check resource levels using 'top' to identify performance/memory issues

5. How would you know if it is failing at 2am?

    - For failing processes I would use a tool like monit (https://mmonit.com/monit/) to monitor the Apache
    processes, restart any that fail, and send an alert email.

    - For catching live issues I would use rollbar (https://rollbar.com/), it's very easy to
    setup and integrates with Angular nicely.
